# Roadmap to Optimal Resource Allocation

Here's the general roadmap.  
I'm not sure about the order of operations, so please feel free to update it.

## Milestones
1. [Self-Improving GitHub Repository](self-improving-github-repo/self-improving-github-repo.md) - Create agents to help to manage the project and convert project requirements into code. 
2. Problems - agents and humans generate the full list of problems that need to be solved
3. Solutions - agents and humans to generate the full list of possible solutions to each problem.
4. ToDo List for Humanity - agents decompose the solutions into tasks that can be completed by agents or humans.
5. [Digital Twin Safe](digital-twin-safe/README.md) - Enable the creation of digital twins for personalized AI agents that mirror our knowledge, values, and preferences.
6. [Positron Agents](positron-network/positron-network.md) - Develop a decentralized network of autonomous agents to manage projects and resources.
7. [Wishonia](wishonian-government/wishonian-government.md) - A virtual world of prosocial agents working 24 hours a data to maximize median health and happiness.
