## Introduction

Wishocracy is a universal wish fulfillment system aiming to connect people's desires (wishes) with potential solvers who can fulfill them. This document outlines the requirements for the Solver Relationship Management (SRM) System, a critical component of Wishocracy responsible for managing solvers. The SRM System will handle tasks essential for maintaining a productive solver community, including profile creation, skill tracking, participation monitoring, communication facilitation, and reputation management.

## Objectives

- Enable solvers to create and manage their profiles.
- Track solvers' skills, interests, and preferences to effectively match them with relevant wishes.
- Monitor and record solver contributions and participation in the system.
- Provide communication and collaboration tools to facilitate interactions among solvers.
- Establish a reputation and trust management system to ensure a reliable solver community.

## Functional Requirements

### Solver Profile Creation and Management

**Description:** Solvers need the ability to create and manage their profiles to participate in Wishocracy effectively.

**Requirements:**

- **Profile Registration:** Solvers must be able to register by providing necessary information like name, email, and password.
- **Profile Details:** Solvers should input and update their general information, including bio, profile picture, and contact information.
- **Account Settings:** Solvers need to adjust their account settings, such as privacy options, notification preferences, and linked social media accounts.

### Solver Skills, Interests, and Preferences Tracking

**Description:** The system should capture and update the skills, interests, and preferences of solvers to optimize the wish matching process.

**Requirements:**

- **Skills Input:** Solvers must input their skills, with the option to categorize them (e.g., technical, creative, managerial).
- **Interests and Preferences:** Solvers should specify their interests and preferences to receive relevant wish proposals.
- **Skill Verification:** Optionally, solvers can verify their skills through certifications, endorsements, or portfolio submissions.

### Solver Contribution and Participation Tracking

**Description:** Track and document solver contributions and participation to maintain an active and engaged solver community.

**Requirements:**

- **Activity Logs:** Maintain logs of solver activities, including wish fulfillment participation, collaborations, and content submissions.
- **Contribution Metrics:** Record metrics such as tasks completed, goals achieved, feedback received, and contribution quality.
- **Participation History:** Provide solvers with a comprehensive view of their participation history.

### Solver Communication and Collaboration Tools

**Description:** Facilitate effective communication and collaboration among solvers to enhance the collective wish fulfillment process.

**Requirements:**

- **Messaging System:** Enable solvers to send private messages, create group chats, and participate in discussion forums.
- **Collaboration Spaces:** Provide tools for collaborative work on fulfilling wishes, like shared documents, task boards, and project timelines.
- **Notifications:** Implement notifications for relevant activities, messages, and updates.

### Solver Reputation and Trust Management

**Description:** Establish a system to assess and maintain solver reputation and trust within the Wishocracy community.

**Requirements:**

- **Reputation Scoring:** Develop a reputation scoring mechanism based on solver contributions, feedback, and participation.
- **Feedback System:** Allow wish requesters and peers to give feedback and rate solvers.
- **Dispute Resolution:** Implement a process for handling disputes, complaints, and negative feedback to ensure fairness.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:** Ensure that all solver data is securely stored and transmitted, with appropriate encryption and access controls.
- **Performance:** The system should handle simultaneous access by a large number of solvers without performance degradation.
- **Scalability:** Design the system to scale smoothly with the growth of the user base.
- **Usability:** Provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for solvers to interact with the system.
- **Interoperability:** Ensure compatibility with other Wishocracy components and potential external systems.

## Existing Systems

Several existing systems offer features that could be adapted or integrated into the SRM System for Wishocracy. They include:

- **LinkedIn:** For profile creation, skill tracking, and endorsements.
- **Upwork/Freelancer:** For contribution tracking and reputation management.
- **Slack/Microsoft Teams:** For communication and collaboration tools.
- **Jira/Trello:** For task and activity management.

These platforms provide a reference point, but Wishocracy's SRM System should be tailored to the unique needs of a universal wish fulfillment ecosystem.
