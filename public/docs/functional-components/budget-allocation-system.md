## Introduction

The Budget Allocation System is a critical functional component within Wishocracy, a universal wish fulfillment system. This document outlines the requirements for implementing the Budget Allocation System, including mechanisms for creating, managing, allocating, tracking, reporting, and adjusting budgets.

## Objectives

- To ensure efficient and transparent allocation of budgets to various problems.
- To provide a robust tracking and reporting mechanism for the allocated budgets.
- To enable dynamic adjustment and reallocation of budgets based on updated priorities and needs.

## Scope

The Budget Allocation System includes all functionalities related to managing budgets: from initial creation to allocation, tracking, reporting, and reallocation. The system will utilize an Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation (APPA) mechanism for making budgetary decisions.

## Functional Requirements

### Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation (APPA) Mechanism

- Should implement a decision-making mechanism that aggregates pairwise preferences of stakeholders to allocate the budget.
- Ensure that the APPA mechanism is scalable and can handle a large number of preferences and stakeholders.
- Provide an interface for stakeholders to input their preferences.
- Aggregate the preferences and determine the priority of budget allocation.

### Budget Creation and Management

- Enable the creation of new budgets with specific parameters (e.g., start date, end date, total amount).
- Allow users to define and manage budget categories.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for managing budgets.
- Enable editing and updating of budget details by authorized users.

### Budget Allocation to Problems

- Integrate with the problem database to fetch problems requiring funding.
- Enable users to allocate budget amounts to specific problems based on the APPA results.
- Maintain a record of budget allocation history.

### Budget Tracking and Reporting

- Track the allocation and usage of budgets in real-time.
- Generate detailed reports on budget allocation and usage.
- Provide different views and filters for report generation (e.g., by date, problem, department).
- Ensure data accuracy and integrity in the reports.

### Budget Adjustment and Reallocation

- Allow for dynamic adjustment and reallocation of budgets based on changing priorities and circumstances.
- Implement mechanisms for rebalancing the budget allocation through consultation with stakeholders.
- Track and log all adjustments and reallocations for audit purposes.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:** Ensure that the system is secure and accessible only to authorized users.
- **Performance:** The system must handle a large number of transactions and provide timely responses.
- **Usability:** The system should have an intuitive user interface that simplifies the management of budgets.
- **Scalability:** The system should be scalable to accommodate increasing numbers of users and budget entries.
- **Reliability:** Ensure high availability and robustness of the system.

## Existing Systems

- **Participatory Budgeting Platforms:** Tools like Balancing Act and Ethelo offer participatory budgeting features, which may include preference aggregation and budget allocation mechanisms.
- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems:** ERP systems like SAP ERP and Oracle ERP Cloud offer comprehensive budget management features but may lack specific preference aggregation mechanisms.

## Assumptions

- Stakeholders are willing to participate and provide their preferences.
- There is a predefined set of problems that require funding.
- Accurate and timely data will be provided for budget creation and tracking.

## Constraints

- Budgetary decisions are subject to organizational policies and approvals.
- Changes in external factors (e.g., economic, regulatory) may impact budget allocation.

## Glossary

- **Wishocracy:** A universal wish fulfillment system.
- **Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation (APPA):** A mechanism for making collective decisions based on pairwise comparisons of options.
- **Stakeholders:** Individuals or groups with an interest in budget allocation decisions.
- **Budget Allocation:** The process of assigning monetary resources to different problems or projects.
- **Reallocation:** Adjusting previously made budget allocations.
