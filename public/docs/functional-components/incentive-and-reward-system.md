## Scope

The scope of this document is to outline and specify the requirements for the Incentive and Reward System within the Wishocracy platform. This component is intended to motivate user participation, recognize contributions, and elevate user engagement through gamified elements and structured incentives.

## Objectives

1. **Motivate User Participation:** Encourage users to engage and contribute by providing meaningful incentives.

## Functional Requirements

### Incentive Mechanism Design

1. Design a system that offers various types of incentives, such as:

   - Points
   - Badges
   - Levels
   - Virtual currencies
   - Exclusive access or privileges

2. Ensure mechanisms are adaptable and scalable to accommodate different levels of user engagement and contribution.

3. Provide a clear and transparent method for users to understand how incentives are earned and their benefits.

4. Facilitate customizable incentives that can be configured for specific types of contributions or achievements.

### Reward Structure and Distribution

2. Implement an automatic distribution system to:

   - Allocate points or virtual currency
   - Award badges and levels

3. Ensure fair and unbiased distribution of rewards.

### Contribution and Achievement Recognition

1. Develop a systematic method to recognize user contributions, such as:

   - Completing tasks or challenges

3. Design status tiers (e.g., Novice, Expert, Master) to signify user levels based on reputation points.

### Gamification and Engagement Mechanics

1. Integrate gamified elements to enhance user engagement, including:

   - Daily or weekly challenges
   - Competitions and leaderboards
   - Mission-based tasks or quests

2. Provide feedback and progress indicators to keep users informed about their journey and milestones.

3. Encourage social interactions through team-based activities and collaborative goals.

## Non-Functional Requirements
