## Introduction

Wishocracy is a universal wish fulfillment system designed to handle and process user wishes seamlessly. The system must ensure robust security and privacy measures to protect user data and maintain trust.

---

## Objectives

1. Establish a comprehensive Security and Privacy Framework for Wishocracy.
2. Ensure the system is compliant with relevant regulations and standards.
3. Protect user data from unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.
4. Implement mechanisms for secure authentication and authorization.
5. Enable effective monitoring and logging to detect and respond to potential threats.

---

## Scope

The Security and Privacy Framework focuses on securing the Wishocracy system across different functional areas:
- Data protection and privacy.
- Secure authentication and authorization.
- Encryption and data integrity.
- Audit logging and monitoring.
- Compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

---

## Requirements

### Data Protection and Privacy Controls

- **Data Minimization:** Ensure only necessary data is collected and processed.
- **Anonymization and Pseudonymization:** Implement techniques to anonymize and pseudonymize personal data.
- **Access Controls:** Enforce strict access control policies to limit data access to authorized users only.
- **Data Retention Policies:** Establish clear data retention and deletion policies.

### Secure Authentication and Authorization

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA to enhance login security.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Apply RBAC to provide users with appropriate access levels based on their role.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Support SSO to streamline user authentication processes.
- **Session Management:** Ensure secure session handling to prevent session hijacking and replay attacks.

### Encryption and Data Integrity

- **Data Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data stored in databases, file systems, and backups.
- **Data Encryption in Transit:** Use TLS/SSL to encrypt data transmitted over the network.
- **Key Management:** Implement best practices for encryption key management.
- **Data Integrity Checks:** Utilize checksums and hashes to verify data integrity.

### Audit Logging and Monitoring

- **Comprehensive Audit Logs:** Maintain detailed logs of system activities, including access and modifications.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implement real-time monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
- **Log Management and Analysis:** Utilize tools for centralized log management and automated analysis.
- **Incident Response:** Establish procedures for incident detection, reporting, and response.

### Compliance

- **GDPR:** Ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation for handling personal data.
- **CCPA:** Comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act for user data protection.
- **ISO 27001:** Follow guidelines from ISO 27001 for information security management.
- **Other Relevant Standards:** Remain compliant with other applicable regulatory standards and best practices.

---

## Assumptions and Constraints

- **Assumptions:**
  - Users have unique identifiers.
  - A designated security team is available for incident response.
  - The system infrastructure supports encryption protocols.

- **Constraints:**
  - Performance requirements must not be significantly impacted by security measures.
  - The chosen security solutions must be cost-effective.

---

## Existing Systems

Several existing systems offer components that may fulfill these requirements:

- **OAuth:** For secure token-based authentication and authorization.
- **Letâ€™s Encrypt:** For free, automated, and trusted encryption using TLS/SSL certificates.
- **Elastic Stack (ELK):** For comprehensive centralized logging, monitoring, and analytics.
- **AWS KMS:** For managed, secure key management services.
- **DataDog:** For real-time monitoring and security incident detection.
