### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Solver Profile Creation and Management

- **Profile Creation:** Allow solvers to create and edit their profiles, including personal information (name, contact details), biography, and profile picture.
- **Profile Privacy:** Enable solvers to set privacy preferences for their profiles, determining what information is visible to others.
- **Profile Verification:** Implement a system for verifying the identity of solvers if required.

#### 2. Solver Skills, Interests, and Preferences Tracking

- **Skills Tracking:** Enable solvers to list their skills, certifications, and areas of expertise.
- **Interests & Preferences:** Allow solvers to specify their interests and preferences regarding the types of wishes they want to fulfill.
- **Skill Matching:** Implement algorithms to match solver skills and preferences with relevant wishes.

#### 3. Solver Contribution and Participation Tracking

- **Activity Log:** Maintain a detailed log of solver activities, including wishes they have worked on, contributions made, and success rates.
- **Performance Metrics:** Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as wish completion rates, feedback scores, and participation frequency.
- **Achievement Badges:** Award badges or certifications to solvers based on their contributions and performance.

#### 4. Solver Communication and Collaboration Tools

- **Messaging System:** Provide a robust internal messaging system for solvers to communicate with each other and with wish requestors.
- **Group Collaboration:** Facilitate group collaboration through channels or groups dedicated to specific wishes or projects.
- **Document Sharing:** Allow solvers to share documents, images, and other files relevant to their work.

#### 5. Solver Reputation and Trust Management

- **Feedback System:** Implement a feedback and rating system for solvers, allowing wish requestors and peers to rate and review solvers' work.
- **Trust Score:** Calculate a trust score for each solver based on ratings, feedback, and completion statistics.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Provide mechanisms for addressing disputes and conflicts between solvers and other users.

---

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:** Ensure secure handling of personal data and communication between solvers.
- **Scalability:** Design the SRM System to handle a large number of solvers and wishes.
- **Usability:** Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing solver activities and profiles.
- **Performance:** Optimize the system for quick response times and minimal latency in communication tools.
- **Compliance:** Adhere to relevant data protection regulations and industry standards (e.g., GDPR).

### Existing Systems

There are several existing systems that provide parts of the functionality outlined for the SRM System. These include:

- **LinkedIn:** Offers comprehensive profile creation, skills tracking, and connection mechanisms.
- **GitHub:** Provides collaboration tools, activity tracking, and reputation management for developers.
- **Slack:** A robust communication platform with messaging, group collaboration, and file sharing capabilities.
- **Upwork:** Manages freelancer profiles with detailed skills tracking, activity logs, and reputation systems.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Solvers must be able to create and update their profiles without technical assistance.
- The system must accurately track and display solver skills, interests, and activities.
- Solvers must be able to communicate effectively and collaborate on wish fulfillment projects.
- A reputation and trust management mechanism must be in place, allowing for reliable feedback and ratings.
