## Overview

The Digital Twin Creation and Management component of Wishocracy is intended to create and manage a digital representation (digital twin) of each user. The digital twin will learn and evolve based on user data, preferences, and behaviors, providing personalized wish fulfillment experiences. This component encompasses several key functionalities to ensure accurate, real-time replication and optimization of user preferences through their digital twins.

## Functional Requirements

### User Profile and Preferences Synchronization
- **Description**: The system should synchronize user profile data and preferences with their digital twins.
- **Sub-tasks**:
  - Retrieve and update user profile information from various data sources.
  - Capture explicit user preferences and implicit behaviors.
  - Ensure data privacy and security while handling user information.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Usersâ€™ profiles and preferences must be accurately reflected in their digital twins.
  - The system should update user profiles seamlessly without significant delay.

### Digital Twin AI Model Training and Updating
- **Description**: Train and update the AI models that define the behavior and characteristics of each digital twin.
- **Sub-tasks**:
  - Collect training data from user interactions and historical data.
  - Use machine learning algorithms to train the digital twin models.
  - Implement continuous learning processes for model updates.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The AI models should correctly imitate user behaviors and preferences.
  - The training process should be efficient and scalable.
  - Models must be updated in a non-disruptive manner to the user experience.

### Digital Twin Performance Monitoring and Optimization
- **Description**: Monitor the performance of digital twins and optimize them for better accuracy and responsiveness.
- **Sub-tasks**:
  - Implement performance metrics and monitoring tools.
  - Analyze the accuracy of digital twins continuously.
  - Optimize algorithms and infrastructure based on performance data.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The performance of digital twins should be consistently monitored with KPIs.
  - Optimizations should lead to improved accuracy and response time.

### Digital Twin Lifecycle Management
- **Description**: Manage the lifecycle of digital twins from creation to archiving.
- **Sub-tasks**:
  - Develop processes for creating new digital twins upon user onboarding.
  - Allow modifications and updates to digital twins as required.
  - Archive digital twins when they are no longer needed while retaining data for future analysis.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The lifecycle of digital twins should be clearly defined and managed.
  - Creation, modification, and archiving should be efficient and user-friendly.

### Real-time Synchronization between Digital Twins and Their Human Counterparts
- **Description**: Ensure real-time synchronization between users and their digital twins.
- **Sub-tasks**:
  - Implement real-time data streaming and synchronization mechanisms.
  - Ensure low-latency updates to the digital twins reflecting user actions and changes.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Synchronization should happen in near real-time allowing digital twins to accurately reflect current user state.
  - User actions and preferences should be mirrored by digital twins instantaneously.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: The system should support a large number of users and digital twins with optimal performance.
- **Security**: Sensitive user data must be protected through encryption and secure protocols.
- **Reliability**: Ensure high availability and minimal downtime.
- **Performance**: Ensure low-latency and efficient processing.
- **Usability**: The interfaces and user interaction workflows should be intuitive and user-friendly.

## Existing Systems

1. **IBM Digital Twin Exchange**: A platform that provides tools for creating and managing digital twins using the IoT and AI.
2. **Siemens Mindsphere**: An industrial IoT service solution that allows for digital twin creation and management, primarily for manufacturing and related fields.
3. **Microsoft Azure Digital Twins**: A platform that enables the creation of comprehensive digital models of physical environments.

## Glossary

- **Digital Twin**: A digital replica of a living or non-living physical entity.
- **AI Model**: Algorithmic models that enable computers to make predictions or decisions without human intervention.
- **Synchronization**: The process of ensuring that data and operations are consistently updated across systems in real-time.
- **KPI**: Key Performance Indicator, a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving key objectives.
