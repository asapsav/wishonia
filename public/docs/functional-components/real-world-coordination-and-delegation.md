# Product Requirements Document

## Component: Real-World Coordination and Delegation for Wishocracy

### Introduction

The Real-World Coordination and Delegation component is a critical part of the Wishocracy system. Its purpose is to allocate tasks and resources effectively between digital twins and human counterparts, ensuring seamless real-world coordination. This document outlines the functional requirements for this component.

### Goals and Objectives

- Facilitate efficient task and resource allocation between digital entities and humans.
- Establish clear communication and notification channels.
- Implement robust progress tracking and status updates for tasks.
- Develop incentive structures that encourage human involvement.
- Create feedback loops and learning mechanisms to improve the system over time.

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Task and Resource Allocation
- **Requirement:** The system must enable efficient allocation of tasks and resources between digital twins and human counterparts.
  - **Description:** Each task should be assessed to determine the best fit between digital capabilities and human intervention.
  - **Features:**
    - Task categorization based on complexity and resource requirements.
    - Smart allocation algorithms that consider current workload and capabilities of digital twins and human users.

#### 2. Communication and Notification Channels
- **Requirement:** The system must provide robust communication and notification channels to ensure real-world coordination.
  - **Description:** Effective communication channels are needed for task assignments, updates, and coordination between digital twins and humans.
  - **Features:**
    - Integration with email, SMS, and instant messaging platforms.
    - A centralized notification hub within the application.
    - Real-time updates and alerts for task changes.

#### 3. Progress Tracking and Status Updates
- **Requirement:** The system must provide accurate progress tracking and status updates for delegated tasks.
  - **Description:** Users must be able to view the progress of tasks in real-time and receive updates on any changes.
  - **Features:**
    - A progress dashboard that displays the status of all tasks.
    - Automated status updates based on task milestones.
    - Manual progress update capabilities.

#### 4. Incentive Structures for Human Participation
- **Requirement:** The system must include incentive structures to encourage human participation and task completion.
  - **Description:** Motivating human users to participate in and complete tasks is essential for maintaining a balanced coordination system.
  - **Features:**
    - Reward mechanisms (e.g., points, badges, monetary rewards).
    - Leaderboards and achievement tracking.
    - Feedback and recognition for high-performing users.

#### 5. Feedback Loops and Learning Mechanisms
- **Requirement:** The system must have feedback loops and learning mechanisms to continuously improve coordination.
  - **Description:** Continuous feedback and learning capabilities allow the system to evolve and optimize task allocation and coordination processes.
  - **Features:**
    - User feedback forms and surveys.
    - Performance analytics for tasks and resource usage.
    - Machine learning algorithms to refine task allocation and communication strategies.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability:** The system must handle a growing number of users and tasks without performance degradation.
- **Reliability:** The system must be reliable, with minimal downtime and robust error handling.
- **Usability:** The interface should be user-friendly and accessible to a diverse user base.
- **Security:** The system must ensure the secure handling of user data and task information.

### Existing Systems and Benchmarking

Several existing systems offer features similar to those required for the Real-World Coordination and Delegation component. These systems can serve as benchmarks for functionality and performance:

- **Trello/Asana:** Project management tools that offer task allocation, communication, and progress tracking features.
- **Slack/Microsoft Teams:** Communication platforms with integrated notification and collaboration capabilities.
- **Amazon Mechanical Turk:** A system that effectively delegates tasks to human workers and tracks progress.
- **Coursera/Duolingo:** Platforms that incentivize participation through gamification and reward mechanisms.

### Conclusion

The Real-World Coordination and Delegation component is pivotal to the Wishocracy system's success. By meeting the outlined requirements, the system will facilitate effective task and resource allocation, robust communication, and continuous improvement through feedback, ultimately ensuring seamless coordination between digital twins and human counterparts.
