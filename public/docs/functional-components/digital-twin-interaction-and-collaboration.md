### Overview
Wishocracy is a universal wish fulfillment system aimed at executing and managing individual and collective wishes effectively. This document details the requirements for the "Digital Twin Interaction and Collaboration" component of Wishocracy.

### Objectives
- Facilitate seamless interaction and coordination between digital twins (each twin representing a user's wish).
- Enable efficient task sharing and execution among digital twins.
- Foster collaborative decision-making and problem-solving.
- Implement robust conflict resolution and consensus-building mechanisms.
- Develop social norms and reputation systems to guide behavior and interactions.

### Scope
The scope of this component includes designing systems and protocols that allow digital twins to communicate, collaborate, make joint decisions, resolve conflicts, and adhere to social norms. It does not mandate specific technology stacks, leaving room for flexibility in implementation.

### Functional Requirements
#### Multi-agent Communication and Coordination Protocols
- **Requirement 1:** Design protocols for real-time communication among digital twins.
- **Requirement 2:** Ensure secure and authenticated communication channels.
- **Requirement 3:** Implement message queuing and delivery guarantees to handle high volumes of communication.
- **Requirement 4:** Create a protocol for dynamic agent discovery and interaction within the system.

#### Shared Task Allocation and Execution
- **Requirement 1:** Develop algorithms for efficient task allocation based on digital twin capabilities and availability.
- **Requirement 2:** Implement a task management system to track task progression and completion.
- **Requirement 3:** Ensure support for complex task dependencies and multi-step workflows.
- **Requirement 4:** Provide mechanisms for reporting task status and performance metrics.

#### Collaborative Decision-making and Problem-solving
- **Requirement 1:** Develop a decision-making framework that allows digital twins to propose, debate, and vote on solutions.
- **Requirement 2:** Implement a distributed problem-solving mechanism that leverages collective intelligence.
- **Requirement 3:** Facilitate real-time brainstorming and ideation sessions among digital twins.
- **Requirement 4:** Ensure the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous collaboration.

#### Conflict Resolution and Consensus Mechanisms
- **Requirement 1:** Create protocols for detecting and managing conflicts between digital twins.
- **Requirement 2:** Develop consensus algorithms for resolving disagreements among digital twins.
- **Requirement 3:** Implement negotiation and mediation tools to facilitate conflict resolution.
- **Requirement 4:** Provide a mechanism for logging and auditing conflict resolution processes.

#### Social Norms and Reputation Systems
- **Requirement 1:** Establish guidelines and norms for acceptable behavior among digital twins.
- **Requirement 2:** Implement a reputation system to track and reflect the reliability and integrity of each digital twin.
- **Requirement 3:** Develop mechanisms for sanctioning and rewarding digital twins based on their behavior and performance.
- **Requirement 4:** Ensure transparency and fairness in the reputation and social norms systems.

### Non-functional Requirements
- **Scalability:** The system must efficiently scale to handle a large number of digital twins interacting simultaneously.
- **Performance:** Ensure low-latency communication and quick response times for coordinated actions.
- **Security:** Implement strong data protection and access control measures.
- **Reliability:** Ensure high system uptime and fault tolerance.
- **Usability:** Provide an intuitive interface for managing and interacting with digital twins.

### Existing Systems and Technologies
- **Multi-agent Systems:** Platforms like JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) provide a foundation for building and managing multi-agent systems.
- **Blockchain:** Technologies such as Ethereum and Hyperledger can be utilized for consensus mechanisms and secure transactions.
- **Reputation Systems:** Systems such as eBay’s feedback system or Amazon’s review system offer insights into building effective reputation mechanisms.
- **Task Management:** Tools like Jira or Trello illustrate features needed for task tracking and management in collaborative environments.

### Appendix
- **Glossary:** Define any specific terms and acronyms used within the document.
- **References:** Include any references to external documents, standards, or web pages referred to in the PRD.
- **Diagrams:** Provide any necessary diagrams or workflows illustrating the interaction and collaboration protocols.

This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for designing and implementing a robust "Digital Twin Interaction and Collaboration" component for Wishocracy, ensuring efficient and harmonious digital twin operations.
