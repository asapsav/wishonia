# Product Requirements Document

## Component: Decentralized Infrastructure for Wishocracy

### Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for the Decentralized Infrastructure component of Wishocracy, a universal wish fulfillment system. The goal of this component is to leverage Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), smart contracts, decentralized storage and computing, effective consensus mechanisms, governance models, and ensure scalability and performance optimization.

### Objective
The Decentralized Infrastructure component will aim to:
- Ensure transparency and immutability of transactions and wishes.
- Automate and enforce rules through smart contracts.
- Utilize decentralized storage and computing for data security and redundancy.
- Enable robust consensus mechanisms to validate transactions and decisions.
- Provide scalable and performant solutions to handle increasing users and transactions.

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Integration
- **Requirement ID:** DI-001
- **Description:** Integrate with a suitable DLT to maintain a transparent, immutable ledger of all wishes.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The DLT should support public and private modes.
  - Ensure secure, verifiable transactions.
  - Provide APIs for interfacing with other system components.
- **Notes:** Existing systems like Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Corda could be considered for integration.

#### 2. Smart Contract Development and Management
- **Requirement ID:** DI-002
- **Description:** Develop and manage smart contracts to handle wish creation, fulfillment, verification, and other automatable processes.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Smart contracts should be capable of processing and validating user wishes.
  - Automated consensus and conditions enforcement without manual intervention.
  - Offer a user-friendly interface for deploying and managing contracts.
- **Notes:** Existing frameworks like Solidity (for Ethereum) or DAML (for Corda) can be used.

#### 3. Decentralized Storage and Computing
- **Requirement ID:** DI-003
- **Description:** Implement decentralized storage and computing solutions to securely store user data, wish details, and other metadata.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Data should be encrypted and redundant across multiple nodes.
  - Ensure availability and fault tolerance.
  - Support for uploading, retrieving, and managing data.
- **Notes:** Systems such as IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), Filecoin, and Storj are potential candidates.

#### 4. Consensus Mechanisms and Governance Models
- **Requirement ID:** DI-004
- **Description:** Deploy effective consensus mechanisms and governance models to validate transactions and manage the network.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Support for Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), or other consensus mechanisms.
  - Clearly defined rules for governance and decision-making.
  - Mechanisms for voting, upgrades, and dispute resolution.
- **Notes:** Algorithms such as Raft, PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance), or Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) could be examined.

#### 5. Scalability and Performance Optimization
- **Requirement ID:** DI-005
- **Description:** Ensure the decentralized infrastructure can scale with the increasing number of users and transactions while maintaining high performance.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Ability to handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS).
  - Efficient sharding or side-chain solutions.
  - Optimized network latency and transaction processing time.
- **Notes:** Layer 2 solutions, cross-chain interoperability, and performance-enhancing technologies like zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) might be explored.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Security
- **Requirement ID:** NFR-001
- **Description:** Ensure all components of the decentralized infrastructure are secure from cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Regular security audits.
  - Implementation of robust encryption methods.
  - Access controls and permissions management.

#### Usability
- **Requirement ID:** NFR-002
- **Description:** Interfaces for managing decentralized infrastructure should be user-friendly and intuitive.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Minimal training requirement for users.
  - Clear documentation and support available.

#### Reliability
- **Requirement ID:** NFR-003
- **Description:** Ensure high availability and fault tolerance within the infrastructure.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - System uptime of 99.9% or higher.
  - Redundant systems in place to handle node failures.

### Dependencies
- Integration with existing DLT platforms and decentralized storage solutions.
- Collaboration with developers proficient in smart contract technologies.
