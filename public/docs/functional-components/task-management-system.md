# Product Requirements Document: Task Management System for Wishocracy

### Introduction

This document outlines the specifications for the Task Management System, a core functional component of the universal wish fulfillment system called Wishocracy. The Task Management System (TMS) is designed to streamline the creation, assignment, scheduling, tracking, and completion of various tasks integral to fulfilling wishes efficiently and effectively.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the Task Management System is to facilitate the efficient management of tasks required to fulfill wishes. This includes ensuring tasks are clearly defined, appropriately assigned, scheduled, tracked, and verified upon completion.

## Scope

The scope of the Task Management System encompasses all functionalities related to task management within the Wishocracy ecosystem. This includes:

- Managing lifecycle stages from creation to verification.
- Providing reporting mechanisms to track progress and outcomes.
- Integrating with other components of Wishocracy.

## Key Features

### Task Creation and Decomposition

- **Task Creation**: Users should be able to create new tasks with descriptions, priorities, and deadlines.
- **Task Decomposition**: Complex tasks should be decomposable into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.

### Task Assignment and Allocation

- **Assignment Mechanism**: Tasks should be assignable to users or groups of users based on roles, expertise, and availability.
- **Resource Allocation**: Allocate necessary resources (time, budget, tools) to each task.

### Task Scheduling and Timeline Management

- **Scheduling**: Establish start and end dates for tasks and sub-tasks.
- **Dependencies**: Define task dependencies and manage the schedule accordingly.
- **Timeline**: Visual representation of tasks and their timelines (e.g., Gantt Chart).

### Task Progress Tracking and Reporting

- **Progress Tracking**: Mark tasks as in-progress, pending, or completed.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on task status, time spent, resource utilization, and outcomes.
- **Notifications**: Send alerts for upcoming deadlines and overdue tasks.

### Task Completion and Verification

- **Completion Criteria**: Define clear criteria for task completion.
- **Verification**: Provide mechanisms for verifying and approving completed tasks.

## User Roles and Permissions

- **Administrator**: Full access to all functionalities; can manage users and system settings.
- **Project Manager**: Can create, assign, schedule, and track progress of tasks.
- **Team Member**: Can view assigned tasks, update progress, and mark tasks as complete.
- **Observer**: Read-only access to task statuses and reports.

## Functional Requirements

- **FR1**: The system shall allow users to create and decompose tasks.
- **FR2**: The system shall support assignment of tasks to specific users or user groups.
- **FR3**: The system shall enable scheduling of tasks with start and end dates.
- **FR4**: The system shall provide visual representations of timelines and dependencies.
- **FR5**: The system shall track progress and status updates for tasks and sub-tasks.
- **FR6**: The system shall generate reports on task completion and resource use.
- **FR7**: The system shall send notifications for task-related events.
- **FR8**: The system shall define and verify task completion criteria.

## Non-functional Requirements

- **NFR1**: The system should be scalable to handle a large number of tasks and users.
- **NFR2**: The system should ensure data security and user privacy.
- **NFR3**: The system should be highly available and reliable.
- **NFR4**: The system should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- **NFR5**: The system should support integration with other Wishocracy components.

## Dependencies

- **Authentication System**: For user login and role-based access control.
- **Notification System**: To send alerts and updates to users.
- **Data Storage**: A robust database to handle task data and related information.

## Assumptions

- Users will have access to the internet and a compatible device to use the system.
- The system will operate within a secure network environment.
- Users will be trained on how to effectively use the TMS.

## Existing Systems

Several existing systems offer functionalities similar to those required by the Task Management System. These include:

- **Trello**: Task creation, assignment, and tracking with Kanban boards.
- **Asana**: Comprehensive project management, including task decomposition, scheduling, and reporting.
- **Jira**: Provides robust task management features tailored for software development but adaptable for general use.
- **Microsoft Project**: Offers detailed scheduling, tracking, and reporting capabilities.

## Glossary

- **Task**: An individual unit of work to be completed.
- **Sub-task**: A smaller, more manageable unit of work derived from a larger task.
- **Gantt Chart**: A timeline visualization tool used in project management.
- **Completion Criteria**: Specific conditions or metrics that define when a task is considered complete.
- **Verification**: The process of ensuring a completed task meets the defined criteria.

This document provides a comprehensive foundation for developing the Task Management System for Wishocracy. Further iterations may refine these requirements based on stakeholder feedback and trial implementations.
