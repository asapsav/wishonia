## Introduction

The Wishocracy Resource Management System (RMS) is a critical component designed to optimize the management and utilization of resources within the Wishocracy platform. The system aims to efficiently manage, allocate, and track resources, facilitating seamless resource requests and approvals. It also provides insights into resource utilization and helps in forecasting and planning for future resource needs.

    - Customizable reporting templates.
    - Predefined reports (e.g., usage trends, under-utilized resources).
    - Export options (CSV, PDF).

### Resource Forecasting and Planning
- **Description**: Predict future resource needs and plan accordingly.
  - **Features**:
    - Demand forecasting using historical data and trends.
    - Scenario analysis and planning.
    - Capacity planning tools.
    - Visual aids (charts, graphs) to support planning activities.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: The RMS should be able to handle increasing amounts of resources and requests without performance degradation.
- **Usability**: The system should be user-friendly and intuitive to ensure a high adoption rate among users.
