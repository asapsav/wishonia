## Overview

The Problem Management System (PMS) is a functional component of the Wishocracy platform, designed to intake, manage, and track issues or problems submitted by users. This system aims to streamline the identification, categorization, prioritization, search, and monitoring of problems to ensure timely and effective resolutions.

## Functional Requirements

### Problem Creation and Submission

- **User Interface**

  - An intuitive user interface for submitting new problems.
  - Form fields: Title, Description, Category, Tags, Attachments (optional), Priority level (optional), and Reporter information.
  - Support for attaching images, documents, or other relevant files.
  - CAPTCHA or other spam prevention mechanisms.

- **Backend**
  - API endpoint for problem submission.
  - Validation for required fields and file types.
  - Store all submissions in a database with a unique problem ID.

### Problem Categorization and Tagging

- **User Interface**

  - Dropdown menus or tag-based input for selecting problem categories and tags.
  - Option for users to suggest new categories and tags.

- **Backend**
  - Predefined set of categories and tags.
  - Algorithm for suggesting relevant tags based on problem description.

### Problem Prioritization and Ranking

- **User Interface**

  - Options for users to set the initial priority during submission (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
  - Ability for administrators to update priority levels.

- **Backend**
  - Priority field in the problem database.
  - Automated ranking algorithm that adjusts prioritization based on criteria such as urgency, impact, and user votes.

### Problem Search and Discovery

- **User Interface**
  - Search bar with filtering options (e.g., Category, Tag, Priority, Status).
  - Display search results with pagination.
- **Backend**
  - Search indexing for quick retrieval.
  - API endpoints for search with support for complex queries (e.g., full-text search, filtering).
  - Caching mechanism for frequently searched queries.

### Problem Status Tracking

- **User Interface**

  - Status indicators (e.g., New, In Progress, Resolved, Closed).
  - Timeline or history view of status changes.

- **Backend**
  - Status field in the problem database.
  - Logging mechanism to track status changes and timestamps.
  - Notifications system to alert users of status updates.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**

  - The system should handle high volumes of problem submissions and queries.
  - Support for horizontal scaling.

- **Performance**

  - Quick response times for both problem submission and search functions.
  - Efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms.

- **Security**

  - Secure data transmission (e.g., HTTPS).
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for sensitive operations.
  - Data encryption for sensitive information.

- **Usability**
  - Intuitive and user-friendly interface.
  - Multi-language support.

## Existing Systems

Several existing systems offer similar problem management functionalities. The following systems may serve as references for implementing the Problem Management System for Wishocracy:

- **Jira**

  - Comprehensive issue and project tracking tool.
  - Offers problem creation, categorization, prioritization, and status tracking.

- **GitHub Issues**
  - Simple issue tracker integrated with repositories.
  - Supports issue creation, labeling, prioritization (via labeling), and status tracking.
