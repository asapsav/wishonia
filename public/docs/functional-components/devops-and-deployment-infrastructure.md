## Overview

Wishocracy aims to implement a robust DevOps and Deployment Infrastructure to ensure efficient, reliable, and scalable deployment of its universal wish fulfillment system. This infrastructure includes CI/CD pipelines, containerization, automated testing, IaC, and comprehensive monitoring and logging systems.

## Functional Requirements

### Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) Pipelines

1. **Automated Build Processes**: Automatically build and compile source code upon code commits.
2. **Automated Testing**: Integrate automated testing to validate code commits before deployment.
3. **Continuous Deployment**: Automatically deploy successful builds to staging and production environments.
4. **Rollback Mechanisms**: Provide automated rollbacks in case of production deployment failures.
5. **Branch Management**: Support feature branching and merging processes.

#### User Stories

- _As a developer, I want my code changes to be automatically tested and built, so I can ensure they are compatible with the existing codebase._
- _As a DevOps engineer, I want to automatically deploy successful test builds to avoid manual deployments and reduce errors._

### Containerization and Orchestration

1. **Container Management**: Use container technology to package applications with their dependencies.
2. **Container Orchestration**: Automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
3. **Service Discovery**: Enable services to discover each other dynamically for communication.
4. **Resilience and Scalability**: Ensure containers are resilient to failures and can scale up/down based on demand.

#### User Stories

- _As a software engineer, I want to containerize my applications to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments._
- _As an operations manager, I want to use orchestration tools to manage application clusters and ensure high availability._

### Automated Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Unit Testing**: Ensure code is tested at the unit level.
2. **Integration Testing**: Validate the integration of components.
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete workflows from start to finish.
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure application performance and identify bottlenecks.

#### User Stories

- _As a QA engineer, I want to automatically run different levels of tests to ensure software quality at every stage of development._
- _As a product manager, I want to ensure that the application performs efficiently under anticipated load conditions._

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Provisioning

1. **Automated Infrastructure Provisioning**: Use code to provision and manage IT infrastructure.
2. **Version Control**: Track infrastructure changes through a version control system.
3. **Reproducibility**: Ensure infrastructure can be consistently recreated.
4. **Security and Compliance**: Implement security best practices and compliance checks in the codebase.

#### User Stories

- _As a DevOps engineer, I want to automate infrastructure provisioning to ensure quick and reliable environment setups._
- _As a security officer, I want to ensure the infrastructure follows compliance and security guidelines._

### Monitoring and Logging Systems

1. **Health Monitoring**: Monitor the health of applications and services.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Collect and analyze performance metrics.
3. **Logging**: Centralize logs for troubleshooting and analysis.
4. **Alerts and Notifications**: Set up alerts for critical issues and thresholds.

#### User Stories

- _As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health of services in real-time to quickly address any issues._
- _As a DevOps engineer, I want to centralize all logs for easier troubleshooting and historical analysis._

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Scalability**: The infrastructure should be able to handle scaling both horizontally and vertically.
2. **Reliability**: Ensure high availability and minimal downtime.
3. **Security**: Adhere to security best practices and compliance requirements.
4. **Performance**: Optimize for performance to handle high loads efficiently.

## Existing Systems

Various tools can be utilized to fulfill the above requirements. Here are some examples:

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Travis CI
- **Containerization**: Docker, Podman
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Amazon ECS
- **Automated Testing**: Selenium, JUnit, pytest, TestNG
- **IaC**: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible, Chef, Puppet
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, Datadog

Each of these tools and frameworks can be evaluated and selected based on the specific needs and constraints of the Wishocracy project.
