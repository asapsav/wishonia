## Introduction

Wishocracy is a universal wish fulfillment system that allows users to propose, evaluate, and implement solutions to various wishes and problems. This document outlines the requirements for the Solution Management System component of Wishocracy.

## Objective

The objective of the Solution Management System is to provide a structured framework for creating, evaluating, categorizing, tracking, and assessing the impact of solutions proposed by users within Wishocracy. This system aims to ensure that proposed solutions are managed efficiently and transparently.

## Scope

This document details the functional and non-functional requirements for the Solution Management System. It includes the following core functionalities:
- Solution Proposal Creation and Submission
- Solution Evaluation and Selection
- Solution Categorization and Tagging
- Solution Status Tracking
- Solution Impact Assessment

## Functional Requirements

### Solution Proposal Creation and Submission

#### Description
Users should be able to create and submit solution proposals. This functionality includes providing a user-friendly interface for solution submission and ensuring that necessary information is captured during the process.

#### Requirements
- **User Interface**:
  - Form to capture solution title, description, objectives, and expected outcomes.
  - Upload functionality for supporting documents or media.
  - Option to save drafts and submit final proposals.
- **Validation**:
  - Ensure mandatory fields are completed before submission.
  - Provide feedback and error messages for incorrect or incomplete submissions.
- **Submission Tracking**:
  - Track the submission status (e.g., draft, submitted, under review).

### Solution Evaluation and Selection

#### Description
Proposed solutions should undergo evaluation by a designated team or community. The system should facilitate and document the evaluation and selection process.

#### Requirements
- **Evaluation Workflow**:
  - Assign evaluators or evaluation committee.
  - Define evaluation criteria (e.g., feasibility, impact, cost).
  - Collect and track evaluator feedback and scores.
- **Selection Mechanism**:
  - Aggregate and analyze evaluation results.
  - Support manual or automated selection of solutions for implementation.
  - Notify users of the evaluation outcome.

### Solution Categorization and Tagging

#### Description
Proposed solutions should be categorized and tagged to facilitate better organization, searchability, and management.

#### Requirements
- **Categorization**:
  - Allow categorization based on predefined categories (e.g., environment, technology, healthcare).
  - Support custom categories defined by administrators.
- **Tagging**:
  - Enable users and administrators to tag solutions with relevant keywords.
  - Support multiple tags per solution for comprehensive classification.

### Solution Status Tracking

#### Description
Track the status of solutions through their lifecycle from proposal to implementation and post-implementation review.

#### Requirements
- **Status Indicators**:
  - Define and track statuses such as submitted, under review, approved, in progress, completed, rejected.
- **Notifications**:
  - Notify users of status changes.
  - Provide a status update log accessible to users and administrators.

### Solution Impact Assessment

#### Description
Assess the impact of implemented solutions to gauge their success and inform future decision-making.

#### Requirements
- **Impact Metrics**:
  - Define and track key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the solution.
- **Feedback Collection**:
  - Collect feedback from stakeholders and end-users.
  - Conduct surveys or collect data on the solution's effectiveness.
- **Reporting**:
  - Generate reports summarizing the impact assessment.
  - Facilitate data visualization for better insights.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability**: Intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- **Performance**: The system should handle a large number of proposals and evaluations without performance degradation.
- **Security**: Ensure data privacy and protect sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: The system should scale seamlessly with the growth in user base and solution proposals.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant data protection and privacy regulations.

## Existing Systems

Several existing systems offer similar functionalities and can provide insights or reference models for the Solution Management System. Some of these systems include:
- **IdeaScale**: A platform for crowdsourcing ideas and managing innovation.
- **Aha!**: A product management tool that allows for idea submissions and prioritization.
- **Monday.com**: A work operating system that can be adapted for managing solution proposals and workflows.

## Appendices

- **Glossary**: Definitions of key terms used in this document.
- **User Personas**: Descriptions of typical users interacting with the system.
- **Workflow Diagrams**: Visual representations of the processes involved in proposal submission, evaluation, and tracking.
