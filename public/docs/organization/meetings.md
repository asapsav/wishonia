# Meetings

SCRUM and Sprint Planning meetings should be transcribed using a service like Fireflies.ai and sent to the Project Manager Agent to turn action items into GitHub Issues and the Documentation Agent to update documentation files in the repository.

### SCRUM Meetings

These should be daily 15-minutes strictly time-limited meetings focused on answering the questions:
1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What are you doing today?
3. What do you need to succeed today?

### Weekly Sprint Planning Meetings

Weekly sprint planning meetings are 1-hour meetings held at the start of each week. The team:
1. discuss the work to be done in the upcoming sprint
2. breaks larger tasks into smaller, manageable tasks
3. assign them to team members
