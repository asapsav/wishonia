# Mechanism for Human-AI Cooperation

**1. Issue Creation and Identification:**
   - **AI-Generated Issues:** The Network Architect Agent, identifies potential enhancements or issues within the network. It then creates GitHub issues detailing these findings.
   - **Human-Generated Issues:** Network participants (developers, non-profit staff, etc.) can also create issues on GitHub to suggest changes, report bugs, or propose new features.

**2. Analysis of Issues:**
   - The Project Manager Agent reviews and analyzes both AI-generated and human-generated issues.
   - It prioritizes them based on predefined criteria such as impact, feasibility, and alignment with the network's goals.

**3. Discussion:**
   - **Collaborative Deliberation:** For each issue, there's a collaborative discussion involving both humans and the AI. The AI can provide data-driven insights, simulations, or projections to inform the discussion.
   - **Feedback Integration:** Humans provide contextual understanding, ethical considerations, and strategic direction. They can offer feedback on the AI's suggestions and analyses.

**4. Pull Request Creation:**
   - **AI-Driven Development:** For issues where AI can autonomously develop solutions (e.g., code optimizations, documentation updates), the AI creates a pull request with the proposed changes.
   - **Human-Driven Development:** For more complex or sensitive changes, human developers make the necessary modifications and submit pull requests.

**5. Review and Merging:**
   - Pull requests are reviewed by both humans and AI.
   - **Human Review:** Humans ensure that the changes align with the overall mission, adhere to ethical standards, and are pragmatically sound.
   - **AI Review:** The AI can perform automated tests, code analysis, and impact simulations.
   - Once approved, the changes are merged into the main branch of the repository.

**6. Continuous Learning and Adaptation:**
   - The Project Manager Agent learns from human feedback (thumbs up and down votes) and decisions made on issues and pull requests, refining its future contributions and analyses.
   - Human participants also gain insights from AI-generated data and recommendations, enhancing their decision-making processes.

**7. Documentation and Transparency:**
   - All discussions, decisions, and changes are documented transparently on GitHub.
   - This ensures a clear audit trail and allows for broader community engagement and oversight.

This human-AI cooperation mechanism facilitates a synergistic relationship where AI enhances human capabilities with data-driven insights and automation, while human participants provide contextual intelligence, creativity, and ethical guidance. GitHub, as a platform, offers an ideal environment for this collaboration, with its APIs and tools for issue tracking, code review, and version control.



## Human Project Manager

A human AI engineer will be responsible for:
1. Coordinating between the various non-profits to ensure the project is aligned with their needs
2. Creating a detailed roadmap for the project
3. Running SCRUM and Sprint Planning meetings
4. Ensuring that meeting transcripts are converted to GitHub Issues and Documentation
5. Creating GitHub Issues for the tasks that need to be completed
6. Creating bounties for the tasks that need to be completed
7. Answering questions from contributors from 9 to 5 PST Monday through Friday
8. Respond to GitHub Issues and Pull Requests within 24 hours on weekdays
9. Facilitate collaborative resource allocation decisions through the use of quadratic funding, participatory budgeting, and retroactive public goods funding

## Automated Task Outsourcing

For tasks that can't be completed by the Positron Network agents, the Outsourcing Agent will be used to outsource tasks to other humans or organizations. The Outsourcing Agent will be responsible for:
1. Creating GitHub Issues for the tasks that need to be completed
2. Creating bounties for the tasks that need to be completed
3. Answering questions from contributors
