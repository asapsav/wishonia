## Q: Why not just focus on smaller focused goals?

By limiting its scope to small organizations, it would not be able to prevent duplication of effort on a global scale.

Research has shown that the quality of decisions made by groups is proportional to the diversity of the group. By focusing on a global scale, Wishocracy can tap into the wisdom of the crowd to make better decisions than any one person or small group of people could make.

This requires a decentralized protocol that can integrate with any existing system rather than a standalone system.

## Q: What's the benefit of a global todo list?

1. **Preventing Waste** - Minimizing duplicated effort by surfacing what problems/wishes people are already working on solving. This allows resources to be allocated more efficiently. Governments and charitable foundations spend billions on solving important problems, but lack of coordination often leads to significant duplication of effort. For instance, if two research organizations each spend $1 million doing animal trials on the same drug, that's effectively $1 million of funding wasted and lots of extra animals suffering for no reason.

2. **Coordination and Cost-Sharing** -
   By decomposing solutions into atomic tasks
   that anyone can contribute to, it enables cost-sharing between organizations that need the same thing.  
   This would enable all organizations to accomplish more with the same amount of resources.

3. **Helping People Maximize Their Impact** - Say you're a charitable individual who wants to improve the world. How can you figure out what the most important thing you can do A global decentralized to do list could help charitable people find the highest impact tasks to work on given their skills and resources.

4. **Iterative Improvement through Impact Tracking** - Iteratively improving allocation of resources over time by feeding impact data back into the prioritization process.

## Q: Even if we had a global to-do list, we need every organization to use it for it to be useful. How will we make it so that every organization decides to use it?

Widespread adoption of a global to-do list could be achieved by:

1. **Demonstrating Cost Savings**: Even if only two organizations use it, it could theoretically cut their costs in half by reducing duplication of efforts.

2. **Providing Competitive Advantage**: For businesses, ["coopetition"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition) would be a competitive advantage, as it increases efficiency and access to resources.

3. **Multiplying Nonprofit Impact**: For nonprofits, it would multiply the impact of donations, attracting donors who want to maximize the effectiveness of their contributions.

4. **Autonomous Agents**: As AI frontier models improve in reasoning, autonomous agents can take on more tasks, further reducing costs and increasing efficiency.

5. **Ensuring Easy Integration**: Seamless integration with existing tools and workflows will minimize adoption friction.
