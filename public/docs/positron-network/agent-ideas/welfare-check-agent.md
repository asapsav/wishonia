## Welfare Check Agent

This agent would make regular calls to elderly or isolated individuals. During the call, it would ask about their well-being, food intake, medication adherence, and any symptoms they might be experiencing. The agent could use natural language processing to understand and respond to the person's needs and concerns.

**Alert System:** If the agent detects any issues, like missed medications, health symptoms, or lack of essential supplies, it would automatically alert family members, caregivers, or emergency services, as appropriate.

**Companionship and Engagement:** Beyond checking on physical needs, the agent could provide companionship, engaging in conversations, sharing news or stories, and even playing simple verbal games to help keep the person mentally active and less lonely.
